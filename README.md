# Code Quiz
On this project I created a Quiz application to test the users code knowledge in JavaScript.

## Description
User is presented with one first page where a start button is available. Once users press start, it is presented with the first question and multiple choices answers. The answers are place inside a button, when users select an answer it moved to the next question until the end of the quiz.
As soon as users click on the answer it displays a text in green saying it is correct, or in red saying it is incorrect. If correct score is added one point, if it is incorrect time is decrease in 10 seconds.
If time reaches zero before users finish the quiz, it is game over, no more questions.
At the end on the quiz user is presented with final score and the ability to save score with his/her initials.
At any time, user can click on the link “View High Scores” to access the saved scores. There the user can clean the saved scores, and or restart the quiz.
